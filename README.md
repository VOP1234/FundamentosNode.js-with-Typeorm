## :rocket: Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:
### Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)


## ðŸ’» Project

Developed a transaction management api, using Node.js along with TypeScript and including the use of a database with TypeORM in addition to sending files with Multer.

This application that stores incoming and outgoing financial transactions
I still allowed the registration and listing of these transactions. It is also allowed to create new records in the database after sending a csv file. (look in the "/ tmp" folder for the example file "file.csv")
